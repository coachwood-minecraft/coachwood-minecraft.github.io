Coachwood is a new Minecraft server I started a week ago while my son was feeling unwell and I was looking for a way to cheer him up.
To be fair, I had been looking for a good excuse to start a Minecraft server anyway!
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m looking to build a community around this server, so over the next few months Iâ€™ll be making this website look a bit more snazzy,
start a Discord server, and look for ways to integrate it all with the Minecraft server.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m new to Minecraft server hosting, so this server is very Vanilla. I want to stay true to pure survival mode, however Iâ€™ll be
adding various mods in service of keeping the server running smoothly and scaling it as necessary, as I learn more about Minecraft servers.

<p>
If youâ€™re looking for a new server to join long-term and to be part of its history, please join <code>mc.coachwood.net</code> and say hi ðŸ‘‹
